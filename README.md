# sq

This is a simplified version of the internal tool `sq` at Square, intended for personal use.

It is based on the same [exoskeleton](https://github.com/square/exoskeleton)
library, but is a relatively thin wrapper over that library.

## Usage

Put executable scripts and binaries in `~/sqbin` to make them discoverable by `sq`.
